# Bloodbank
 I have used Angular(javascript library)and angular marterial UI component libraries to design and implement the code.
 
 To run this code
 1. First download node.js
 2. Then install angular/cli globaly using command 'install -g @angular/cli'
 5. To clone the code on to local system  use command 'git clone https://github.com/gowthamiedamalapati/Bloodbank.git' by clicking 'git bash here' on desktop or any folder to download code from git repository
 5. Now that the code is downloaded into local machine open angular project(subfolder called bloodbank) in code editor and run command 'npm install' and 'ng serve' to run the application, angular application is now running on port 'localhost4200'
 
 GitHub URL- 'https://github.com/gowthamiedamalapati/Bloodbank.git'

 web URL for the code is 'http://localhost:4200/'
